// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

aNumber <- USERINPUT 
IF aNumber % 2 == 0 
 THEN 
	PRINT "The number is even"
 ELSE
	PRINT "The number is odd"
ENDIF

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

FOR i in 1 to 5
	userVal[i] <- USERINPUT
ENDFOR
tally, maxVal, minVal <- userVal[1]
FOR i in 2 to 5
	tally <- tally + userVal[i]
	IF userVal[i] > maxVal 
		THEN maxVal <- userVal[i]
	ELSE IF userVal[i] < minVal 
		THEN minVal <- userVal[i]
	ENDIF
ENDFOR
avgVal <- tally/5
PRINT "The average of user inputs is:" + avgVal
PRINT "The smallest user input was:" + minVal
PRINT "The largest user input was:" + maxVal
